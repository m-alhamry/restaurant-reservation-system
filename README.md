DineAura, a restaurant reservation system designed to make table booking smooth for customers and simple for restaurant staff. Diners can easily select a date, time, and party size, while staff get a clear overview of all reservations and the option to either confirm or reject the reservation. Our goal was to create a user-friendly, functional app that tackles a real-world problem, while sharpening our full-stack development skills. Building this together as a team made the process both fun and rewarding.

Technologies used: JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, EJS, bcrypt (for password hashing), dotenv (for environment variables), express-session (for session management), method-override (to support HTTP verbs like PUT and DELETE), morgan (for logging), Multer, CSS, HTML, Git, GitHub.


Next Step: Weâ€™ve already implemented user authentication and a reservation approval system where staff can confirm or reject bookings. Moving forward, we plan to enhance the user interface, add email notifications for reservation updates, and build a dashboard with analytics for restaurant staff. We also aim to introduce social media sign-up options, verification codes for added security, and expand the platform to support multiple restaurants for a more dynamic experience.
